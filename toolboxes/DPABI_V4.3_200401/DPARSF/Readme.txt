Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) is a convenient plug-in software within DPABI, which is based on SPM. You just need to arrange your DICOM files, and click a few buttons to set parameters, DPARSF will then give all the preprocessed (slice timing, realign, normalize, smooth) data, functional connectivity, ReHo, ALFF/fALFF, degree centrality, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) results. DPARSF can also create a report for excluding subjects with excessive head motion and generate a set of pictures for easily checking the effect of normalization. You can use DPARSF to extract ROI time courses efficiently if you want to perform small-world analysis. DPARSF basic edition is very easy to use while DPARSF advanced edition (alias: DPARSFA) is much more flexible and powerful. DPARSFA can parallel the computation for each subject, and can be used to reorient your images interactively or define regions of interest interactively. You can skip or combine the processing steps in DPARSF advanced edition freely. Please download a MULTIMEDIA COURSE to know more about how to use this software. As a component of DPABI, please add with subfolders for DPABI in MATLAB's path setting and enter "dpabi" in the command window to enjoy this powerful toolbox.
